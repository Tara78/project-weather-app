# Weather App
This a forecasting single-page application which shows 5 days of forecasting weather in different cities. 

## The problem
1-	Git was the difficult part. 
2-	Organizing the functionality was not so easy either & hooking functions inside each other was struggling for us as well.  

## How we solve issues
By practicing and asking some professional developers we overcome those issues. 
We found a model in one of the weather forecasting-app on google. And we kept that model as our model. We started to work with each other on the first day on the master branch and we agree on all details. 
when the base was finished, we divided our tasks, and we followed the Agile Methodology. Every day we had stand-up meetings and discuss what we did the day before and what we going to do today. 

If we had more time, we could work on Geolocation API to make it more professional and easier for users.
